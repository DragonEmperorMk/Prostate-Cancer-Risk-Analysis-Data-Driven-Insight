# Prostate-Cancer-Risk-Analysis-Data-Driven-Insight
 This project applies exploratory data analysis, correlation studies, and visualizations to uncover key clinical and demographic indicators influencing prostate cancer risks. Ideal for learning medical data analysis and applying statistical insight extraction using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
# 🧬 Prostate Cancer Risk Analysis – Data-Driven Insight

This project performs a comprehensive analysis on a **synthetic prostate cancer risk dataset**, leveraging Python's data science stack to uncover meaningful patterns, risk factors, and insights that could aid in clinical decision-making or early detection strategies.

## 🎯 Objective

To identify, explore, and visualize **key risk factors** associated with prostate cancer, focusing on:
- Demographic trends (age, race, family history)
- Clinical indicators (PSA levels, Gleason score, DRE results)
- Correlation between features and cancer occurrence

---

## 🧪 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes anonymized records with the following features:

- `Age`
- `Race`
- `FamilyHistory`
- `PSA_Level`
- `DRE_Result`
- `GleasonScore`
- `Cancer` (target variable: 1 = Positive, 0 = Negative)

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Analysis Includes

- Statistical summary & data cleaning
- Class imbalance check (Cancer vs Non-Cancer)
- Correlation matrix to assess linear relationships
- Visual breakdown of PSA, age, and Gleason score by cancer status
- Insights on demographic patterns such as race and age brackets

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- **Bar Charts**: Distribution of cancer risk across races and family history
- **Boxplots**: PSA
